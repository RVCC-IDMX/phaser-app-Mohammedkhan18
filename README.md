# Choose Your Adventure Game

This project is a text-based interactive game built using [Phaser](https://phaser.io/). The game features a series of scenes where the player makes choices that affect the outcome of the story. The goal is to navigate through different story paths by selecting options that lead to different scenes. Players will be able to make choices in a dynamic, visually engaging environment with interactive buttons and background changes.

## How to Run Locally?

To install all dependencies, run the following command in your terminal:

`npm install`

Once all dependencies are installed, to run the project, use:

`npm run dev` 

This will launch the game in your default browser. You can then start making choices that affect the game's outcome.
